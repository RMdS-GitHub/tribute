                        the discoveries of the first active volcanoes spotted
                        beyond Earth at the moon Io (discovered on March 9 in 
                        optical navigation images), the Jovian ring system and 
                        two moons (Thebe and Metis). Scientists also find that 
                        the Great Red Spot is a huge cyclone-like storm, 
                        Ganymede has grooved terrain (suggesting an early 
                        history of tectonic activity), and Jupiter has 
                        lightning (the first time lightning is detected at a 
                        world beyond Earth). The spacecraft encounter reveals 
                        other strange phenomena connected to Io: Ions stripped
                        from its surface create a torus (or doughnut) around 
                        Jupiter and inflate the planet's magnetic field; and Io 
                        acts like an electric generator in Jupiter's magnetic 
                        field, sending 5 million amperes of current along the

                        approach to Jupiter. Highlights of the encounter include
                        the first images of Jupiter's ring system; discovery of 
                        a third moon (Adrastea); and a close approach to the 
                        moon Europa, which reveals intersecting linear features 
                        that suggest cracks in ice over a liquid water ocean. 
                        Voyager 2 observes that six of the Io volcanoes erupting 
                        during Voyager 1's encounter are still erupting -- 
                        meaning their active periods last at least several 
                        months, and that Io's volcanoes can turn on and off.

                        <b>November 9, 1980 </b><mark> Voyager 1 makes its 
                        closest approach to Saturn’s largest moon Titan and 
                        Saturn itself. Highlights from the Saturn encounter 
                        include the discovery of three moons (Atlas, Prometheus 
                        and Pandora). The discovery of Prometheus and Pandora 
                        around Saturn’s F ring confirms scientists’ theory that 
                        shepherding moons have to exist around narrow rings to 
                        keep ring material in line. The kinked, multi-stranded 
                        nature of Saturn’s F ring is also seen for the first 
                        time. Other highlights include the discovery of ghostly 
                        features in Saturn’s rings that resemble broad spokes 
                        in a wheel and views of the surprisingly bright surface 
                        of Enceladus. Data gathered from the Titan encounter 
                        show a thick, Earth-like atmosphere -- the first 
                        nitrogen-rich atmosphere found beyond our home planet --
                        and suggest the possibility of seas of liquid methane 
                        and ethane on Titan’s surface. After the Saturn 
                        encounter, Voyager 1 begins its trip out of the solar 
                        system, heading upwards out of the plane of the planets.

                        encounters with several of Saturn’s icy moons (including 
                        Tethys, Iapetus and some of the moons discovered on

                        Saturn from this encounter are later stitched together

                        closest approach to Uranus, the first time the seventh 
                        planet from the Sun has been seen up-close. Upon 
                        approach, Voyager 2 images reveal 11 new moons 
                        (Puck, Juliet, Portia, Cressida, Desdemona, Rosalind, 
                        Belinda, Perdita, Cordelia, Ophelia and Bianca). 
                        Bewildering images of the moon Miranda show that it 
                        likely experienced periods of heating from the tug of 
                        other Uranian moons. Scientists also learn that Uranus’s 
                        magnetic field is tilted, so that the poles of its 
                        magnetic field are closer to the equator, unlike the 
                        Earth where magnetic pole and the rotational poles are 
                        nearly aligned. Voyager 2 is the first to image Uranus’s 
                        very dark rings and to detect temperatures as 
                        low as minus 353 degrees (59 Kelvin), which makes Uranus
                        the coldest planet in our solar system. 
                        This encounter also marks the first time NASA’s Deep 
                        Space Network, which enables Earth to communicate 
                        with spacecraft beyond the moon, arrays antennas 
                        together to improve our ability to capture the weak

                        visit four planets beyond Earth. Highlights from the 
                        encounter include the discovery of six new moons in its 
                        images (Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Proteus, Naiad and 
                        Thalassa), the first images of Neptune’s rings, and the

                        Neptune’s southern hemisphere, dubbed “The Great Dark 
                        Spot.” Five hours after the closest approach to Neptune, 
                        Voyager 2 gave us our first close-up views of Triton, a 
                        bitterly cold, fractured moon with terrain the texture 
                        of a cantaloupe rind and geysers erupting from pinkish-
                        hued nitrogen ice that forms the moon’s south polar cap.

                        <b>August 30, 2007 </b><mark> Voyager 2 crosses the 
                        termination shock into the heliosheath, the outer layer 
                        of the bubble the Sun blows around itself and all of the 
                        planets. This time, antennas at Earth are listening for 
                        Voyager 2’s data transmissions and scientists are able 
                        to analyze the first measurements of the passage through 
                        the termination shock.</mark>

                        longest-operating mission, breaking the previous record

                        <b>August 25, 2012 </b><mark>Voyager 1 enters 
                        interstellar space, passing beyond the heliopause, which 
                        is the boundary between our solar bubble and the matter 
                        ejected by explosions of other stars. It is the first 
                        time a human-made object crosses the threshold of 
                        interstellar space. Since the spacecraft is continually 
                        collecting data, Voyager detects the full intensity of 
                        cosmic rays in interstellar space for the first time on 
                        this day and also makes the first measurement of the 
                        interstellar magnetic field wrapped around the outside 
                        of the heliosheath. The crossing itself, however, 
                        is not confirmed until April 9, 2013.</mark>

                        <b>April 9, 2013 </b><mark>Voyager 1 makes the first 
                        measurement of the density of the interstellar medium, 
                        when a wave caused by a coronal mass ejection from the 
                        Sun reaches Voyager 1 and causes the plasma in 
                        interstellar space to ring. The high pitch of the 
                        ringing indicates the density of the plasma surrounding 
                        Voyager 1 is more than 40 times higher than previously 
                        measured, confirming the spacecraft is in the 
                        interstellar space and has been since Aug. 25, 2012.
